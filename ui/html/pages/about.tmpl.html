    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
        When I first got into programming, I was focusing on front end web development. <a
            href="https://victoriagerman.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">My wife</a>, a UI/UX
        designer would create designs for me in Figma and I would write the HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Before
        long, I had completed the University of Helsinki's <a href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">Full Stack Open program</a> which was focused on building single
        page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

    </p>
    <p>
        After a year or so, my wife and I started building custom Wordpress sites for clients. I learned how to
        build traditional Wordpress themes with PHP as well as custom Gutenberg blocks with React. These
        projects forced me to think a lot more about practical things like content management systems and
        hosting solutions. I started getting more interested in cloud technologies as well as
        non-Javascript-based backends.
    </p>
    <p>
        My main focus now is writing Go and learning cloud native technologies. I first encountered Go in <a
            href="https://boot.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a
            backend web development bootcamp</a> and have since fallen in love with the language and surrounding
        ecosystem. My job in IT has furthered my interest in automation and infrastructure. It's the main reason
        I started building out <a href="/blog?tag=homelab">my homelab</a> and <a

            rel="noopener noreferrer">collecting AWS certifications</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not programming, I'm probably hanging out with my wife and my beautiful baby girl
        with whom I am obsessed. I still love singing and I have been fortunate enough to be a part of
        some really <a href="https://www.crossingchoir.org/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">incredible
            ensembles</a>.
